            <p>Note the lack of the <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;</code>,
                which disables the zooming aspect of sites in mobile devices. In addition, we reset our container's width
                and changed the navbar to prevent collapsing, and are basically good to go.</p>

            <p>As a heads up, the navbar component is rather tricky here in that the styles for displaying it are rather
                specific and detailed. Overrides to ensure desktop styles display are not as performant or sleek as one
                would like. Just be aware there may be potential gotchas as you build on top of this example when using the
                navbar.</p>


            <p>Non-responsive layouts highlight a key drawback to fixed elements. <strong class="text-danger">Any fixed
                    component, such as a fixed navbar, will not be scrollable when the viewport becomes narrower than the
                    page content.</strong> In other words, given the non-responsive container width of 970px and a viewport
                of 800px, you'll potentially hide 170px of content.</p>
            <p>There is no way around this as it's default browser behavior. The only solution is a responsive layout or
                using a non-fixed element.</p>
